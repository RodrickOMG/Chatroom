# Chatroom
This is my Computer Network final projiect, which is a chatroom based on Python and Socket. For GUI, I use Tkinter and tkmacosx, so there might be some bugs in Windows or Linux. After the final exam I will try to fix them...

And thanks to [Python-Chatroom](https://github.com/Hurray0/Python-Chatroom), it give me some hints and I've learned many knowledges from it.
