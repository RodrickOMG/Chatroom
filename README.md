# Chatroom
This is my Computer Network final project, which is a chatroom based on Python and Socket. For GUI, I use Tkinter and tkmacosx, so there might be some bugs in Windows or Linux. After the final exam I will try to fix them...

And thanks to [Python-Chatroom](https://github.com/Hurray0/Python-Chatroom), it give me some hints and I've learned many knowledges from it.

First of all, you need to run server.py to start the chat server. Then run client.py to open chat client. You can chat in group or private, even you can create a new group like WeChat. And you can also send pics and documents, but it still exists some bugs.

Besides, after using it for a while, the temp folder may be full of pictures and documents, you need to clean it.
